### a. Context Scenarios
On Monday, Peh Min went to her university. She went there to promote her club event, so she set up a publicity booth. Then, she put a lot of flyers on the table, also a promotional video playing in the screen. Then she go paste posters at the bulletin board in front of the library. From morning until evening, there are only few people that really ask about the event. Others were like took the poster or flyer and just threw it into dustbin. She realised that the students will not really give attention on the poster that pasted on the bulletin board, they will just ignore it and walk by it. 

During night time, while she was thinking how to solve this problem. She realise that she need something interactive that will catch the attention of the students to promote her event effectively.
